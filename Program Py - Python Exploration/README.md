Create a script in the Python language.

All execution, compiling, and testing of this script should ONLY be done in the bash prompt 
on our class server!

Your script must satisfy the following requirements:

Be contained in one single file, called mypython.py.
When executed, create 3 files in the same directory as your script, each named differently 
(the name of the files is up to you), which remain there after your script finishes executing. 
Each of these 3 files must contain exactly 10 random characters from the lowercase alphabet, 
with no spaces ("hoehdgwkdq", for example). The final (eleventh) character of each file should 
be a newline character.

When executed, print out on screen the contents of the 3 files it is creating.

When executed, after the file contents of all three files have been printed, print out two random 
integers (whose range is from 1 to 42, inclusive), and print out the product of the two numbers.

You do not have to parse and read the data back in from the files created in step 2 in order to 
complete step 3. For step 3, just dump the contents that you already randomly generated in your 
program directly onto the screen, if that's the easiest way for you.
